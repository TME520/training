`boom` manages your text snippets on your command line. You can stash away text like URLs, canned responses, and important notes and then quickly copy them onto your clipboard, ready for pasting.

```
$ boom gifs
Boom! Created a new list called "gifs".

$ boom gifs shirt http://cl.ly/NwCS/shirt.gif
Boom! "shirt" in "gifs" is "http://cl.ly/NwCS/shirt.gif". Got it.

$ boom shirt
Boom! Just copied http://cl.ly/NwCS/shirt.gif to your clipboard.
